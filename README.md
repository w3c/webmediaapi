The [Web Media API Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webmediaapi) previously maintained repositories for two other specifications that have since been deprecated:
- [Web Media Application Developer Guidelines](https://github.com/w3c/webmediaguidelines/)
- [Web Media User Agent Integration](https://github.com/w3c/webmediaporting)

The [Web Media API Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webmediaapi) was proposed by and continues to cooperate with the [CTA WAVE Project](https://cta.tech/Research-Standards/Standards-Listing/WAVE-Project/WAVE-Project.aspx)

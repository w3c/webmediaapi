    <section id="abstract">
      <p>This specification defines the Web APIs that should be included in device implementations to support media web apps in 2017. This specification should be updated at least annually to keep pace with the evolving Web platform. This specification is comprised of references to existing specifications in W3C and other specification groups. The target devices will include any device that runs a modern HTML user agent, including televisions, game machines, set-top boxes, mobile devices and personal computers.</p>
      <p>The goal of this Web Media API Community Group specification is to transition to the W3C Recommendation Track for standards development.</p>

      <h2>Required specifications</h2>
      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Required APIs are meant to be available in 2016 in a usable form in the four major web user agent code bases (though there are no requirements around explicit version number or release date for any client code bases). This is to enable the APIs to be delivered in consumer products in 2017.</p>
        <p>The approach taken in this draft is to only include specifications that are of particular significance to application programmers, but not include all the specifications cited by those included specifications. For example, IETF RFC 1345, Character Mnemonics and Character Sets [[RFC1345]] is required by the HTML5 spec included here, but is not included as a required specification here.</p>
        <p>Where an API is made available by a <quot>polyfill</quot>, responsibility for providing the polyfill lies with the developer.</p>
        <section>
          <h3>APIs not widely implemented across all web platforms</h3>
          <p>When requiring conformance to a specification in this section, it must be recognised that parts of some web specifications are not currently implemented across all web platforms and may never be. Consequently, these features may not be present in some implementations of this specification and will not be tested as part of our tests. Any such APIs are noted as exceptions under that API.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>At-risk features</h3>
          <p>Some specifications referenced in this section may not have reached Recommendation and, as such, may contain 'at-risk' features. Since the most common reason for features being marked as at-risk is lack of implementations, such features may not be present in some implementations of this specification and will not be tested as part of our tests.</p>
